  As you know, You're role defines your mission in this game.  If you're a tourist, there's no mission for you. You just need to survive till the end of the game.
  <br>You should eat food, remain alive and enjoy the island. The other thing you should worry about is your money. Pay money when needed. Pay in a way that you can afford it.
  <br>The Real Deal is when you're a shopkeeper. You have limited time to sell certain products. The winner is the shopkeeper with the most benefit percent.
